## How this block editor works ?
 - The block editor leverages the _**`EditorJS` module API**_.
 - The [app.js](./src/app.js) file has the **_fundamental functionalities_** alongside the [custom-block.js](./src/custom-block.js) file which is just used to show the **_custom code blocks_** that can be **_developed as an addition_**.
